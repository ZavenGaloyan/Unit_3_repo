# Unit 3 Project: Gym logging application
 # Criteria A:
 ## Problem definition
My client wants an application that can track their gym progress and workouts in a user-friendly and efficient way. The app should allow users to create a profile, set fitness goals, log their daily exercises, and monitor their progress over time. The user should be able to view and analyze their workout data, including the number of reps, and weights lifted for each exercise. The app should also provide workout recommendations based on the user's fitness level, goals, and progress. The app should be available on both python supporting platforms, and it should have a clean and modern user interface that is easy to use and navigate. The app should be secure and protect users' personal information and workout data.
 ## Success Criteria
1.The app should provide a secure login and sign-up system, allowing users to create a new account or log in using an existing account.

2.The app should provide a clear and organized menu system, allowing users to access different features and functions of the app easily.

3.The app should allow users to easily log their workouts, including the date, time, exercise, reps, and weights lifted.

4.The app should provide detailed statistics and visualizations of users' workout data, including progress over time, improvements in strength.

5.The app should include a calendar system, allowing users to view their workout logs by date during the current month so that they can plan and track their workouts.

6.The app should provide a suggested or explore workout page, allowing users to discover new exercises or workouts to add to their routine.

 ## Rationale for Proposed Soultion
Python is a great programming language for building a workout tracking application as it's known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. Python's versatility enables developers to create the logic of the application, such as processing user input, calculating metrics from data, and data visualization. Python's object-oriented programming features allow developers to create reusable code, enhancing maintainability and scalability of the application.

SQL databases can handle the vast amount of data generated by workout logs, including exercises performed, and weight lifted. SQL provides advanced querying capabilities, allowing users to filter and sort their workouts by different criteria such as dates and exercise types. SQL databases also ensure that data is always consistent and accurate. Developers can use an ORM like SQLAlchemy to create and manage a database and easily perform CRUD operations.

Kivy is a Python framework for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Its cross-platform support allows for easy development and deployment of the application across multiple platforms such as desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Kivy provides a range of widgets and tools for building interactive and user-friendly GUIs, such as buttons, labels, text inputs, and drop-down lists. Kivy's graphics engine is based on OpenGL, providing fast and smooth animations and transitions. Kivy also supports touchscreens and multi-touch input, making it ideal for further development of mobile applications. Developers can use the KivyMD library to create a modern-looking interface for their workout tracking application.

Combining Python, SQL databases, and Kivy can provide an efficient and flexible way to build a workout tracking application with a user-friendly GUI interface. Developers can use Python to create the logic of the application, SQL databases to store and manage the workout data, and Kivy to build an interactive and user-friendly GUI. The combination of these tools provides an efficient and scalable way to build a modern-looking application that can help clients achieve their fitness goals by tracking and analyzing their workout progress. Additionally, these tools have a large community and support, providing developers with a wide range of resources and documentation to help them build and maintain the application.
 # Criteria B:
 ## Flow Chart

</p>
 
 **Fig-1**: The flow chart above depicts the process that the python program does to enter information that is inputed by the user into the database. The differance in symbols and colors are differant properties and processes that allow the program to compelete the process of entering information. It also includes validation so that the program is less likely to malfunction from the user inputs.  
 ## System Diagram

  **Fig-2**: The image above shows the system diagram of how the overall program function along with the computer system it was developed upon. It shows the imput deices and the computer hardware. Which are both used to run the python programming language, kivy library, and sql databases. It shows the process by which the computer runs and what aspects of the system it uses to execute the output screen.   
 ## WireFrame Diagram
 ![](https://github.com/ZavenGaloyan/Unit_3_repo/blob/main/wireframes.jpg)
 
  **Fig-3**: The Wireframe diagram shown above is a visual representation of the layout and design of a user interface. It is a skeletal framework that shows the basic structure of the application without including specific design elements such as colors, fonts, or images. It only shows the user inputs and which screens they lead to with black arrows seen above. If the user where to click on a given button it would correspond to the screen that the arrow is pointing to.  
 ## UML Diagram
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ZavenGaloyan/Unit_3_repo/blob/main/UML.drawio.png" alt="Example image">
</p>
 
  **Fig-4**: The UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram shown above is a visual representation of the system used in the program by using standardized symbols and notation. The diagram above is a Class diagram to be specific, which is a diagram that shows the structure of a system by defining its classes, attributes, methods, and relationships. it also shows how these classes are connected with the black arrows seen above. 
  ## ER Diagram
 ![](https://github.com/ZavenGaloyan/Unit_3_repo/blob/main/ER.drawio.png)
 
  **Fig-5**: The ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram above is a type of database diagram that illustrates the relationships between entities in a database. It is used to model the data in a given database and show how the entities in that specifc database are organised and there respective datatypes.
